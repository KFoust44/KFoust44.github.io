    <h3>With Terraria 1.4 AKA "Journeys End" finally out I figured I would make a build guide for myself and others that enjoy playing this game as much as I do.</h5>
    <h4>Although I'm not familiar with the new gear so I'll add what I see fit when I come across it in my playthrough.<h4>
      <h5>All pictures on this website are screenshots of Terraria taken by me.</h5>

   <p>To be clear this isn't a playthrough guide, it's simply a guide that tells you what to look for gear-wise.</p>
   <p>There are four main classes, each one has it's own unique fighting style that fits different types of people.</p>
