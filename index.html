    <h1>Terraria</h1>
    <h3>With Terraria 1.4 AKA "Journeys End" finally out I figured I would make a build guide for myself and others that enjoy playing this game as much as I do.</h5>
    <h4>Although I'm not familiar with the new gear so I'll add what I see fit when I come across it in my playthrough.<h4>

   <p>To be clear this isn't a playthrough guide, it's simply a guid that tells you what to look for gear-wise.</p>
   <p>There are four main classes, each one has it's own unique fighting style that fits different types of people.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="melee.html">Melee</a></li>
      <li><a href="ranged.html">Ranged</a></li>
      <li>Magic</li>
      <li>Summoner</li>
    </ul>
